      The majority of our products we sell have been designed in house and
      manufactured exclusively for Lymyted. Our product team have decades of
      experience and a six sense on what the next best selling item will be.
      Should you wish to stock our products, please contact us.

      We also work with key retailers, bringing their ideas to life. In
      conjunction with our China office, we are able to undertake OEM / ODM
      orders. We are able to supply all our products on an FOB / EXW / CIF
      basis.
