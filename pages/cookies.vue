    <p>What are Cookies?</p>
    <p>
      These are not the cookies that we eat. Cookies are text files containing
      small amounts of information which allow our site to recognise your device
      and are downloaded to your device when you visit a website if you agree to
      the site doing so. Cookies are then sent back to the website on each
      subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s
      device and are widely used in order to either make websites, work more
      efficiently, let you navigate between pages, remember your preferences,
      and generally improve your user experience. They can also help to ensure
      that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

      Our site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of lymyted.com.
      This helps us to provide you with a better experience when you browse our
      website and make improvements. Some of the cookies we use are “analytical”
      cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and
      to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it. This
      helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring
      that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

      Cookies do not contain confidential information such as your home address,
      telephone number or credit card details. We do not exchange cookies with
      any third party websites.

      Whether or not you allow us to download cookies is up to you, but if you

      and its features may not necessarily work in the same way or produce the
      same personalised experience. If you delete all of your cookies, you will
      have to update your preferences with us again. If you use a different
      device, computer profile or browser you will have to tell us your
      preferences again.
